To do
-----

- Download dependencies using libcurl. Make sure to handle (at least) http,
  https, ftp and file protocols.

- Extract tarballs, zip files, etc. after downloading.

- Compound expressions for conditions:
  
  os "win" and bits "64"
  os "win" or bits "64"
  os not "win"

  We should try to keep the set of supported operations as small as possible
  while remaining useful. We don't want to encourage complicated conditions,
  but we also want to avoid unnecessary nesting & duplication in the deps file.
 
- Replace hand-rolled parser with a flex & bison generated one, for ease of
  future maintenance/extensibility.

- Use dynamic allocation for the variable lists (because someone is bound to
  hit the hard-coded limits sooner or later).

- Per-project configuration mechanism allowing customisation of where downloads
  get stored; whether they all go to the same directory or a separate directory
  per url; etc. Maybe use 'git config' settings for this?

- Subcommands for: listing all deps for current platform, listing deps which
  are/aren't missing, downloading all (or a subset of) deps, removing a dep,
  etc.
