To do
-----

- Extract tarballs, zip files, etc. after downloading.

- Per-project configuration mechanism allowing customisation of where downloads
  get stored; whether they all go to the same directory or a separate directory
  per url; etc. Maybe use 'git config' settings for this?

- Factor out the command-line handling code.

- Subcommands:
  - init: initialise the deps setup for this project. Equivalent to git init,
    creates directories & sets up initial config).
  - list: list all the deps for the current platform. Should have flags for only
    showing missing deps, only downloaded deps, etc.
  - get: download all missing deps, replacing copies which come from a different
    URL to that specified in the deps file.
  - install: extract downloaded deps into their correct project locations.
  - uninstall: delete any extracted deps files from the project.
  - delete: clear out the downloads folder.

- Before downloading, check that we won't end up with two or more URLs being
  downloaded to the same local file.

- Better error reporting. We handle errors gracefully at the moment, but don't
  tell the user what's gone wrong.

- Make sure we don't download files we already have.

- Windows support.
