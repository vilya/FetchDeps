To do
-----

- Set up more variables by default:
  - Set 'bit' correctly for the system
  - Variables describing the default compiler(s), ABI versions, etc.
  - Environment variables.

- Set variables on the command line.

- Extract tarballs, zip files, etc. after downloading.

- Per-project configuration mechanism allowing customisation of where downloads
  get stored; whether they all go to the same directory or a separate directory
  per url; etc. Maybe use 'git config' settings for this?

- Subcommands for: listing all deps for current platform, listing deps which
  are/aren't missing, downloading all (or a subset of) deps, removing a dep,
  etc.

- Before downloading, check that we won't end up with two or more URLs being
  downloaded to the same local file.

- Better error reporting. We handle errors gracefully at the moment, but don't
  tell the user what's gone wrong.

- Windows support.
